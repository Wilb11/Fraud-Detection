Credit Card Fraud Transaction

Fraud Detection This repository hosts the implementation of a fraud detection model by Wilbert Nathanael Limson (Kaggle Username: Wilb11) for identifying fraudulent financial transactions. The approach involves a meticulous process beginning with data preprocessing, where missing values, outliers, and errors are addressed. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides valuable insights into the dataset, including top fraud-prone cities and jobs, and timing patterns of fraudulent activities. Feature engineering techniques, such as cluster analysis based on location data, are employed to enrich the dataset with additional predictive features. Model development encompasses training and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, with RandomForest and XGBoost emerging as the top performers. Despite computational limitations hindering hyperparameter tuning via grid search, a stacked model approach combining RandomForest and XGBoost models demonstrates improved accuracy and F1 score. Future improvements may include implementing grid search and pipelines for better handling of categorical data. Overall, this project offers a comprehensive framework for fraud detection in financial transactions, with opportunities for further refinement and optimization.
